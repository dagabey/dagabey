# Howdy ðŸ¤ ðŸ‘‹
I'm Gabe, a 13 year-old dude in Austin TX currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope to develop websites, chrome/firefox extensions, and eventually make desktop apps with C#.

I am constantly using what I learn to make small projects which I will upload here for you to check out.ðŸ˜„
